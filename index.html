			<h2>Photography project 
			</h2>

			<h3><b>Littore</b>
				
			</h3>

			<p>
				
				This series of photographs was taken around my childhood home in Northern France. I grew up in a former coal mining city, in a very industrial landscape. I seek to interrogate the different ways we can see, dream and reinvent a familiar place, the different version of realities. I am trying to evoke a sense of escape in a very industrial and normed environment. Light is used to alter classical representation and create an abstract portrait of my environment.

			<h3><b>Artificial intelligence, GAN as another new art technique
</b>
				
			</h3>
<p>
There has been a lot of attention given to artificial intelligence in the art world after Christies decided to auction its first painting of the genre created by the Parisian collective Obvious. Several media outlets expressed their anxiety that computers might replace artists. Towards what apocalyptic world are we heading to, if computers are not only replacing us but are better than us? And what are we if something so unique and distinctive of mankind as art can be manufactured by a mere algorithm?

</p>

<p>

But all that conversation does not seem to clearly understand the nature of creative artificial intelligence. A lot of work of art in the field of artificial intelligence is created with the use of GAN: Generative Adversarial Network. GANs are a class of algorithms that can learn to mimic data points. 

</p>

<p>

Artists are setting up training sets that can replicate an image or mix two images together for exemple. It does mean that the intention, the act of creation or if you prefer the rules are set by the artist (the human artist). The act of creating is therefore the work of the artist, the ‘GAN’ is merely replicating what was set. No computer has any agency over what is produced. 

</p>

<p>

We can even go as far as saying that artificial intelligence is just another technique, another technology that artists can choose to use or not. In the same way you can choose to paint a landscape or take a picture. These techniques are different but one is not better than the other. It is similar to the introduction of electricity in music. Electricity is not creating the melody, it is enhancing and changing the nature of the work. 
Artificial intelligence is not the artist. The artist, even the artist in the field of artificial intelligence, is still here.
